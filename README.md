/********** Summary ***********/

For this project, I created a simple game of tic-tac-toe.
This was a relatively straightforward project that helped
me practice using modules in code. I can definitely notice
an improvement in my code structure and quality since the
first few projects I completed in JavaScript.

I could have spent more time allowing players to enter their
names and reset the board, but I felt that those features
were trivial to implement, and are more focused on HTML/CSS
than on JavaScript. 

I would have added a variable for player name and replace 
"Player _" with the name of the current player. I also 
initially created a function to clear the board, but since I 
am not implementing the reset button I decided to remove it.
